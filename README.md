  In this paper, we have analyzed the local business data and reviews to get insights on the popularity of a business and factors responsible for it. We have also analyzed the sentiments of the customer reviews for better understanding of business popularity. The total size of the dataset is 180 MB and we have adopted cloud computing service like Big Data Hadoop using HiveQL and Pig for query. Our preferred choice of framework for this project was Big Data Hadoop primarily because it is an open source software and its scalability and flexibility best suited our requirements.
  This project has helped us in understanding various aspects of the Local Businesses; factors driving their popularity, customer review patterns and regions that favor certain businesses the most, are a few of the many aspects to name. Analyzing the customer sentiments based on their reviews has helped us in realizing the importance of customer satisfaction, also it is possible to derive action plans to improve business performance to keep up with the competition.
